Requirements
==============
This tool was written using Java 1.8 with JavaFX and Maven as its build tool.
This means you will need the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to a valid Java 8 Home.

**Note that due to a limitation of controlsfx you will need to use a version of this tool appropriate for your version of Java. This version of the tool requires at least Java 1.8.0_40**<br>
The reason for this is discussed in [this](http://fxexperience.com/2014/09/announcing-controlsfx-8-20-7/) blog post

Running using Maven
====================
mvn jfx:run


Creating a Jar
===============
